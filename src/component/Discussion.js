    <h3>THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR DISCUSSION</h3>
    <p>
      Our objective in striving for identity equity is never to exclude an
      employee, client, or anyone else. We are aspiring to start a conversation
      for change first and foremost. We expect to make mistakes because they are
      a benchmark of progress. But all progress is gradual, and solutions are
      only found through an iterative approach.

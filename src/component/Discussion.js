        Our objective in striving for identity equity is never to exclude an
        employee, client, or anyone else. We are aspiring to start a
        conversation for change first and foremost. We expect to make mistakes
        because they are a benchmark of progress. But all progress is gradual,
        and solutions are only found through an iterative approach.

      <p>
        We are a group of innovators, developers, and moonlighters pushing for
        change in an industry lacking inclusion. We believe diversity is worth
        the investment. This is why we stand by the principle of identity
        equity--the right to fair opportunity regardless of identity. An
        individual's identity is self-determined but often refers to their
        background. Identity should not be grounds for disqualification, rather,
        an individualâ€™s unique identity is valuable in harboring an ecosystem
        that produces innovation. Companies that lack a diverse workforce put at
        risk the ability to find the proper solution for everyone.
